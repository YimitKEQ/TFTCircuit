                    <h2>1. Mastering Economy</h2>
                    <p>Economy is the engine of your game. Without a strong economy, you cannot afford the champions and levels needed to build a winning composition. The key is to understand interest breakpoints.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Interest:</strong> For every 10 gold you have saved (up to 50), you earn +1 bonus gold at the end of the round. Your goal should be to reach 50 gold as quickly as possible without sacrificing too much health.</li>
                        <li><strong>Streaking:</strong> Winning or losing multiple rounds in a row grants bonus gold. Protecting your streak is a powerful economic tool.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>2. When to Level vs. Roll</h2>
                    <p>This is one of the most difficult decisions in TFT. Here's a simple framework:</p>
                    <h3>Leveling</h3>
                    <p>You level up to add more units to your board, which is the most significant power spike you can get. Prioritize leveling when:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You are on a win streak and want to press your advantage.</li>
                        <li>You are stable and want to push towards your final composition.</li>
                        <li>You need to add a key unit to activate a powerful synergy.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Rolling</h3>
                    <p>You roll to upgrade your existing units, making them stronger. Prioritize rolling when:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your board is weak and you are losing too much health.</li>
                        <li>You are looking for specific 1, 2, or 3-cost champions in a "reroll" composition.</li>
                        <li>You have reached your desired level (e.g., level 8) and are now looking to complete your composition by finding your 4 or 5-cost carries.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. Understanding Tempo</h2>
                    <p>Tempo refers to the pace of the game and the relative strength of the lobby. If other players are leveling aggressively and building strong boards, the tempo is high. If everyone is saving gold, the tempo is low.</p>
                    <p>You must adapt to the tempo of your lobby. If you try to greed for economy in a high-tempo lobby, you will lose too much health and be eliminated before you can spend your gold. Conversely, if you roll too much in a low-tempo lobby, you may be strong in the short term but will fall off late-game as other players have a stronger economy.</p>
